# Stealth Converter

Video encoder to assemble standard videos into 360Â° videos.
The challenge was to break YouTube copyright infringement by embedding classic
videos into 360 ones and upload it on YouTube.
As it took a lot of time to process videos we designed the executable with
three parts to be able to distribute the computations on multiple computers.
The original video is splitted then each sub-video is sent to a different
machine that will do the conversion process. Finally the sub-videos are
reassembled into a whole.
To further increase performance we parallelized the conversions of the frames
when a configurable option is activated.

## Getting Started

The project is not installable, you however can get the executable
(giving that you have the adequates prerequisites) by simply
cloning the repository and running cmake.

### Prerequisites

- OpenCV      3.2.0

- libavfilter 5.40.101
- libavformat 56.40.101
- libavcodec  56.60.100

### Example

```
git clone https://github.com/Tauril/stealth-converter.git
cd stealth-converter
./configure -DPARALLEL=[0,1]
cmake stealth-converter
make
```

## Using the program

The parallel option is to be set with the configure

```
./configure -DPARALLEL=[0,1]
```

### Usage

help:
```
./stealth-converter [-h|--help]
```

split:
```
./stealth-converter [-s|--split] <Video_Path>
```

convert:
```
./stealth-converter [-c|--convert] <Video_Path>
```

reassemble:
```
./stealth-converter [-r|--recombine] <Sub_videos>
```
